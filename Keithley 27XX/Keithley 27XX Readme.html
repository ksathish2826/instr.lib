<h4>2. Required Software</h4>
Some software components need to be installed before using this instrument driver. The minimum versions of these components are listed below, and can be downloaded from the Download Site.

VISA 5.0 or later

Note: VISA has additional software requirements. For example, unless you are using a serial interface, 
NI-VISA requires that NI-488.2 and/or NI-VXI be installed on your system. Check with VISA help for additional 
support software and hardware requirements.

For more details, refer to the <i>LabVIEW Help</i> under <i>Help&raquo; VI, Function, &amp; How-To Help</i>.</para>

<h4>3. Known Issues</h4>


To report issues or provide feedback about this instrument driver,  <a href="http://www.ni.com/en-us/support.html">please contact technical support</a>..


As written, the driver only supports ASCII and Single Precision Binary transfers.  The instrument will support Double Precision Binary transfers, however the code will need to be modified to handle this transfer method.  The Data Format VI will need to be updated with this option.  The Read VIs will need modifications marked in the "Binary" case statement.
When Configure Reference.vi is called with a Scan List,  the Relative Value will not be set, and the Relative Measurements will not be turned on. 
Temperature Scans of sample count greater than 1 with only one channel in the scan list will not initiate the scan correctly.
When Auto Ranging is set to False (in Configure Measurement.vi), if you are only scanning one channel with sample count greater than 1, the driver will not initiate a measurement and the read VI will timeout.  

Note:  The 2701 is a TCPIP enabled device.  The instrument must be set up to use TCPIP, which can include enabling the DHCP client.  The VISA Resource Name throughout the driver will not be auto-detected and must be manually entered at the beginning of the application.  Example: "TCPIP::192.168.1.1::1394::SOCKET"
Real-Time Clock support is not consistent across measurements (buffered only) and data transfer (binary only).  This can be achieved within LV using the LV time VIs and relative timestamps from the instrument.
